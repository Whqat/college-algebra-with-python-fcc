 PROBLEM:

 "Terry is skiing down a steep hill. Terry's elevation, E(t), in feet
 after t seconds is given by E(t) = 3000 - 70t.

 Write a complete sentence describing Terry's starting elevation and
 how it is changing over time."












 SOLUTION:

 From E(t) = 3000 - 70t, we can conclude that Terry's starting point 
 was 3000 feet up, and it's decreasing by 70 feet / second.


 We were asked to "describing Terry's starting elevation and how it is
 changing over time" in one complete sentence:

 Terry started at 3000 feet elevation and when he started skiing, the rate
 of change of elevation was -70 feet/second, meaning he was going down 70 feet
 every second. We can also find the time in seconds where he would reach the
 ground:  3000 - 70t = 0  ->  -70t = -3000  -> 70t = 3000  ->  t = 3000/70 = ~42.3 seconds
