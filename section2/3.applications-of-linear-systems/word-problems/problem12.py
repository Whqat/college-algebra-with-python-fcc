 PROBLEM:

 "Gabrielle is famous for her trail mix recipe. By weight, the recipe calls for 50% 
 pretzels, 30% Cheerios, and 20% peanuts. She wants to make a 2kg container of her mix.
 If pretzels cost $9.99/kg, Cheerios cost $6.99/kg, and peanuts cost $4.95/kg, what
 is the average cost per 100 g rounded to four decimals?









 SOLUTION:

 Ok, this one seems a bit confusing so let's just extract whatever information we can.

 If she wants to make a 2kg container of her mix and that container is going to be
 50% pretzels, 30% cheerios, and 20% peanuts, we can probably find out the weight
 of each ingredient in the recipe if we were to make a 2kg container out of them.


 WEIGHT OF EACH INGREDIENT TO MAKE A 2KG CONTAINER:

 Pretzels =  0.5*2    (50% of 2kg)   =   1.0 kg
 Cheerios =  0.3*2    (30% of 2kg)   =   0.6 kg
 Peanuts  =  0.2*2    (20% of 2kg)   =   0.4 kg


 COST OF EACH INGREDIENT TO MAKE A 2KG CONTAINER:

 Pretzels = 1.0 * 9.99  =  $9.99 (for 1.0 kg)
 Cheerios = 0.6 * 6.99  =  $4.18 (for 0.6 kg)
 Peanuts  = 0.4 * 4.95  =  $1.98 (for 0.4 kg)

 TOTAL = $16.15 (for 2kg)


 "What is the average cost per 100 g rounded to four decimals?":

 Cost Per 100g = Total/20 = 16.15/20 = $0.8082

 NOTE: We divided by 20 because we wanted to get per 100g, if we divided by 10 only
 we would get per 200g because this is 2kg and not 1kg.
