 In algebra, the slope of a line is a measure of its steepness.
 It is calculated as the rise over run, which means the change
 in the y-coordinate divided by the change in the x-coordinate.
 The slope can be positive, negative, zero, or undefined.

 A positive slope means that the line goes up as you move to the right.
 A negative slope means that the line goes down as you move to the right.
 A zero slope means that the line is horizontal.
 An undefined slope means that the line is vertical.

 The slope formula is:

 m = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1)

 where:

 *m is the slope
 *y2 and y1 are the y-coordinates of two points on the line
 *x2 and x1 are the x-coordinates of two points on the line

                                                x1  y1     x2 y2
 For example, if the two points on the line are (1, 2) and (3, 5),
 then the slope is:

 m = (5 - 2)/(3 - 1) = 3/2

 This means that the line goes up 3 steps for every 2 steps you move
 to the right.

 The slope of a line is a useful concept in algebra and geometry.
 It can be used to:

 *Find the equation of a line          i.e: y=2x+1
 *Compare the steepness of two lines
 *Solve problems involving lines
 *Find the rate of change and predict certain outcomes (only in linear equations since they're consistent)

 The slope of a line can be used to find the equation of the line,
 and vice versa.

 If we have the slope and we want to find the equation of that slope
 we can use the "slope-intercept formula"
 
 The slope-intercept form of the equation of a line is:

    y = mx + b

 where:

 y is the y-coordinate of a point on the line
 x is the x-coordinate of a point on the line
 m is the slope of the line
 b is the y-intercept, which is the point where the line crosses the y-axis

 Or, in other words.

 y ⇒  how far up or down is the line, 
 x ⇒  how far along is the line,   
 b ⇒  the value of y when x = 0
 m ⇒  how steep the line is.


 The y=mx+b formula can be used to get the value of any of the above

 Example: getting just the equation

 slope = 2        (m)
 y-intercept = 3  (b)

 y = mx + b

 y = 2x + 3     (The equation used/linear function)


 Example: getting b (y-intercept)

 Point on the line of the equation = (1,1)
 Another point on the same line = (2,4)

 y2 = 4
 y1 = 1
 x2 = 2
 x1 = 1

 slope = y2-y1 / x2-x1  =  4-1 / 2-1  =  3 / 1  =  3   (m)

 x = 1 (or 2)
 y = 1 (or 4)

 -> y = mx + b

 -> 1 = 3(1) + b

 -> 1 = 3 + b

 -> -2 = b   AKA   b = -2


 y = mx + b is the slope intercept form of writing the equation of a straight
 line. In the equation 'y = mx + b', 'b' is the point, where the line intersects
 the 'y axis' and 'm' denotes the slope of the line. The slope or gradient
 of a line describes how steep a line is. It can have either a positive or
 a negative value. When a standard form of a linear equation is of the
 form Ax + By  = C, where 'x' and 'y'  and 'C' are variables and 'A', 'B'
 are constants, the slope-intercept form is the most preferred way
 of expressing a straight line due to its simplicity, as it is very
 easy to find the slope and the 'y intercept' from the given equation.


 Here's a practical real-world example:

 Say you want to predict the number of people who have the flu
 by a specific year. Let's say that year 0 is the starting point,
 and year X is the year that you want to predict the number
 of people who have the flu.

 x-axis: year , y-axis: flu cases   (it's a convention to always put time as our x-axis)

 The data points that you have are (0, 10) and (3, 30).
 The first point tells you that there were 10 people who had the flu
 in year 0, and the second point tells you that there were 30 people
 who had the flu in year 3.

 The slope of the line will tell you how many more people are 
 expected to have the flu each year. In this case,
 the slope is (30 - 10) / (3 - 0) = 20/3.
 This means that you expect the number of people who have
 the flu to increase by 20/3 each year.

 Since we now have the slope (m), we can get the y-intercept (b),
 which is the point where the line intercepts the y-axis.

 You can get it through just using the given data points as your
 x and y  in  y = mx + b since you already have the slope:
 
 10 = 20/3*0 + b  -> 10 = 0 + b  ->  b = 10

 OR, since you understand that b represents the intercepted part of
 y-axis, you can extract it instantly by understand that when x is 0
 in a given point, that point is on the y-axis (intercepting it), and
 the first data point we have is (0,10) where x is 0 and y is 10 which
 means that the point is on the y-axis at coordinate 10 so it intercepts
 it at 10, therefor b = 10
 

 So, if you want to predict the number of people who
 will have the flu in year 5 (x=5), you can use the slope-intercept formula
 to calculate the value of y (cases) when x is equal to 5 (year).

 For example, if Y is 6, then you would calculate:

 -> y = mx + b
 -> y = 20/3 * 6 + 10
 -> y = 40

 This means that you predict that there will be 40 people who have the
 flu in year 6.

 Of course, this is just a prediction. The actual number of
 people who have the flu may not always follow this trend.
 However, the slope-intercept form can be a useful tool
 for making informed predictions about future outcomes.

 
 Real World Problem:

 "A gym membership with two personal training sessions costs $125, while
 the same gym membership with six personal training sessions costs $260.
 
 What is cost per session?"

 First we have to understand the meaning of y = mx + b in the context of this problem.

*y is the dependent variable, which means that it depends on the independent
 variable, x. In this case, y is the total cost of the membership,
 and x is the number of personal training sessions.
*m is the slope of the line, which tells us how much y changes when x changes
 by one unit. In this case, the slope is ~35, which means that the total cost of
 the membership increases by $35 for each additional personal training session.
*b is the y-intercept, which tells us the value of y when x is zero. In this case,
 the y-intercept is ~50, which means that the cost of the membership is $50 even if
 there are no personal training sessions. In other words, it basically means our line
 starts at $50, so the starting cost is $50 which in our case is the membership.

 To extract the meaning of y = mx + b in other problems, you can follow these steps:

 1.Identify the dependent and independent variables. The dependent variable is the
   variable that you are trying to predict, and the independent variable is the
   variable that you are using to make the prediction.
 2.Understand the meaning of each term in the equation. The slope tells you how much
   the dependent variable (y) changes when the independent variable (x) changes by one 
   unit. The y-intercept tells you the value of the dependent variable when the
   independent variable is zero.
 3.Substitute real-world values into the equation to see how it works. This can help
   you to understand how the equation relates to the real-world problem that you are
   trying to solve.

 Here are some additional tips for extracting the meaning of y = mx + b in other problems:

 Look for clues in the problem statement. The problem statement may explicitly state
 the meaning of each term in the equation.

 Consider the units of each term. The units of y and x should be the same. The units
 of b will depend on the units of y and x.

 Think about the real-world context of the problem. What does it mean for the dependent
 variable to increase by one unit? What does it mean for the independent variable
 to be zero?

 Here are some other things to keep in mind when using the
 slope-intercept form to predict certain outcomes:

 *The more data points you have, the more accurate your prediction
 *The more evenly-spaced the given data-points, the more accurate the prediction


 NOTE:
 If you know the slope of a line, you can plug it into
 the slope-intercept form of the equation to find the equation
 of the line. And if you know the equation of a line, you can plug it
 into the slope-intercept form to find the slope of the line.

 Time for python :)

'''

# Slope in python

# Let's start by creating a simple function to calculate the slope for us

def slope_of(y2,y1,x2,x1):  # Take y2 y1 x2 x1 as parameters (input)
    try:
        return (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        return "Slope is undefined"

# Let's test it works:

print(slope_of(4, 1, 2, 1))   # 3.0  (3/1)
print(slope_of(5, 2, 3, 1))   # 1.5  (3/2)
print(slope_of(0, -2, 2, 0))  # 1    (2/2)
print(slope_of(1, 0, 1, 0))   # 1    (1/1)
print(slope_of(2, 5, 1, 1))   # Undefined (-3/0)


# Now let's merge what we just learned with matplotlib

# The point of this code is to show how to find the equation of a line
# and then plot the line on a graph. The code can be modified to find the
# equation of any line and to plot the line on any graph.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Our 2 data points
x = 1
y = 7
x2 = 2
y2 = 10

# Develop the equation y = mx + b
m = slope_of(y2, y, x2, x) # This gives us the rate of change
# To get b, we can isolate it in y=mx+b by subtracting both sides by mx
b = y - m*x          
print(f"y = {m}x + {b}")  # This is the equation

# For the graph
xmin = -10
xmax = 10
ymin = -10
ymax = 10

# For the line on the graph
y3 = m*-10 + b 
y4 = m*10 + b 

# Basic setup for the graph
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
plt.axis([xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax]) # window size
plt.plot([xmin,xmax],[0,0],'b') # blue x axis
plt.plot([0,0],[ymin,ymax], 'b') # blue y axis

# Plot the linear function as a red line
plt.plot([-2,3],[y3,y4],'r')

plt.show()
