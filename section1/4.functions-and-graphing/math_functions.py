'''
 Functions in mathematics are similar to python functions

 Unlike python though, functions are usually called just "f", while
 in python you can name a function literally anything

 A mathematical function also takes in parameters (inputs) in parenthesis
 i.e: f(x)

 Here's an example of a mathematical function:

 Declaring the function

 -> f(x) = 2x + 3

 Passing an input (parameter in python)

 -> f(4) = 2 * 4 + 3  (2 * 4 can also be written as 2(4) in mathematics)
