 PROBLEM:

 "The cost in dollars of making x items is given by
 the function C(x) = 10x + 500.

 1) What is the cost of making 25 items?

 2) Suppose the maxiumum cost allowed is $1500. What
    are the domain and range of the cost function, C(x)?




 SOLUTION:

 1) C(25) = 10*25 + 500 -> 250 + 500 = $750

 2) 10x + 500 = 1500    subtract 500 from both sides to isolate 10x

 -> 10x = 1000

 -> x = 100             divide both sides by 10 to isolate x

 Therefor, if the maximum cost allowed is $1500, you can create 100 items.

 Domain is the set of amount of items we can make with $1500, which would be
 any number of items that's under 100 and above 0

 Domain: { 0 ≤ x ≤ 100 }  # this means any number from 1-100

 
 Range of a function is the set of all possible outputs, which is contrary to 
 the domain (set of possible inputs).

 Range: { C(x) ≤ $1500, where x ≤ 100 } #This means that the cost function can
                                        produce any cost less than or equal
                                        to $1500 depending on the number of items
                                        with the maximum number of items being 100.
                                        
                                        
 NOTE: If you don't fully get this, don't worry. We'll get back to this a little bit later down the line.
