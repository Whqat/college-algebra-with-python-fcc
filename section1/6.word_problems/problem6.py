 NOTE: This problem is a little bit advanced and we will
       talk about this more in-depth later, but I just want
       you to get an idea of it.

 PROBLEM:

 "The height h of a projectile is a function of the time t it is
 in the air. The height in feet for t seconds is given by the non-linear
 function h(t) = -16t^2 + 96t. What is the domain of the function?

 SOLUTION:

 The domain is the set of possible values that can be passed to the function.
 
 Which in our case is any number that's not negative because, realistically
 speaking, time can't really be negative. We can't calculate the height the
 projectile is currently at before it even launches off of the ground.

 So our domain will be all numbers except negative numbers.

 Domain = { t ∈ R | t ≥ 0 } # Set of all real, positive numbers
