For this challenge, you need to create three math games using Python.


Scatter plot game:
Randomly generate points on a graph and the player has to input the (x,y) coordinates.
For added difficulty, make the graph larger.


Algebra practice game:
Generate one-step and two-step problems with random integer values and the player
has to input the answer. Use positive and negative values.
For added difficulty, make the numbers larger.


Projectile game:
Display a "wall" with random height and location. Players enter a, b, and c values
for the equation ax^2 + bx + c which attempts to create a parabola that curves over
the wall (throwing a projectile over a wall).
