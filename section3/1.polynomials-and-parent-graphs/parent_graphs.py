Parent graphs are the most basic graphs of functions from which other functions can be
derived by applying transformations such as stretching, shrinking, reflecting,
and translating.

Example of a parent graph: The parent graph of the quadratic function family
is the graph of the function y = x² (x squared). This graph is a parabola that opens
upwards and passes through the origin.

Example of a non-parent graph: The graph of the function y = x² + 3 is not a
parent graph. It is a transformation of the parent graph y = x² by shifting it 3 units
upwards.

Another example of a parent graph is the graph of the linear function y = x. This
graph is a line that passes through the origin and has a slope of 1.

Here is a table of some common parent graphs and their corresponding function families:

_____________________________________________
|   Parent graph    |    Function family    |
|-------------------|-----------------------|
| y = x             | Linear functions      |
| y = x²            | Quadratic functions   |
| y = √x (sqrt(x))  | Square root functions |
| y = e^x           | Exponential functions |
| y = log_a(x)      | Logarithmic functions |
|___________________|_______________________|

Any graph that can be obtained from a parent graph by applying transformations is
called a non-parent graph. For example, the following graphs are all non-parent graphs:

The graph of the function y = -x² is a reflection of the parent graph y = x² across the x-axis.
The graph of the function y = x² + 3 is a vertical shift of the parent graph y = x² by 3 units upwards.
The graph of the function y = 2x² is a vertical stretch of the parent graph y = x² by a factor of 2.
The graph of the function y = √(x + 3) is a horizontal shift of the parent graph y = √x (sqrt(x)) by 3 units to the left.


Why are parent graphs important?

Parent graphs are important because they can help us to understand the behavior of
different types of functions. By understanding the parent graph of a function family,
we can predict how the graphs of other functions in that family will behave under
different transformations.

For example, knowing that the parent graph of the quadratic function family is the
parabola y = x², we can predict that all quadratic functions will have graphs that
are similar in shape to the parabola y = x². We can also predict that the graphs of
quadratic functions can be transformed by shifting them up and down, stretching and shrinking them vertically, and reflecting them across the x-axis and y-axis.

Parent graphs can also be used to help us graph functions. By graphing the parent graph
of a function family first, and then applying transformations, we can easily graph any
function in that family.
